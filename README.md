# About Me

<p align="justify">
    Good day. Welcome to my homepage.</p>

<p align="justify">
    I graduated both bachelor and Ph.D. degrees in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore in the year of 2014 and 2018, respectively.</p>

<p align="justify">
    In my bachelor study, I specialized in control systems and clean energy branches, and graduated with First Class Honour and Dean's List. Besides study, I also joined some societies, such as IEEE NTU Student Chapter and NTU Astronomy Society.</p>

<p align="justify">
    In my Ph.D. study, I focused on machine learning and optimization algorithms in the domain of AI x IoT applications: smart buildings, such as energy efficiency and thermal comfort evaluations over centralized Air-Conditioning and Mechanical Ventilation (ACMV) systems. I also joined in societies together with research and study, such as IEEE Student, INNS Student, IEEE Industrial Electronics Society (Singapore Chapter), IEEE NTU Student Chapter and NTU Astronomy Society.</p>

<p align="justify">
    I had been working in Department of Systems Science (SS) at Institute of High Performance Computing (IHPC) at Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) as a research scientist from 2018 to 2021. After A*STAR, I had been working in Department of Digital & Technology and Department of Data & Digital at Keppel Ltd. as a data scientist (Exp.) and manager since 2021. The research interests focus on data analytics, machine learning and optimization algorithm development over different domains of AI x IoT, such as maritime, supply chain, logistics, industrial production line, smart buildings, data centre, market analytics, etc. </p>

<p align="justify">
    Besides the abovementioned, I had also been in academic societies, such as IEEE Singapore Section, IEEE Young Professionals, IEEE Industrial Electronics Society, IEEE Smart Cities Ambassadors, Elsevier and Yaseen Panels.</p>
